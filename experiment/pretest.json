      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! The mean is $E[Z] = E[X] + E[Y] = 2 + 3 = 5$, and the variance is $Var(Z) = Var(X) + Var(Y) = 4 + 9 = 13$.",
        "b": "Incorrect variance; check the sum of variances.",

        "a": "Correct! The correlation coefficient is given by $\\rho(X_1, X_2) = \\frac{\\Sigma_{12}}{\\sqrt{\\Sigma_{11}\\Sigma_{22}}}$, which equals 0.7 in this case.",
